# Chameleon
A encryption algorithm written in C++ with a lot of bitwise operations

## How it works
Chameleon is based on the fact that characters can be seen as numbers. It also uses a lot of bitwise operators and simple mathematical operations.
Chameleon is also a very fast encryption algorithm, that can ecrypt around 40 megabytes per second.
The chameleon encryption is secure and unpredictable, using a 4 to 8 bit key, and a constants (called CHAMELEON inside the prorgram)
